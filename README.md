# Laravel Project Setup Guide

Complete guide to clone and setup this Laravel project in your local environment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:
- PHP >= 8.2
- Composer
- Node.js & NPM
- MySQL

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaboiazka/sic-guild-fitclub.git
cd sic-guild-fitclub
```

### 2. Install PHP Dependencies
```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Install JavaScript Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Setup Environment File
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

After copying the `.env` file, open it and configure your database settings:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=sic-guild-fitclub
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### 5. Generate Application Key
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 6. Run Database Migration
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 7. Build Assets & Run Development Server

You have **2 options** to run the development server:

**Option 1 - Run Everything with Composer (Recommended):**
```bash
composer run dev
```
This command will run both the backend server and frontend asset compilation automatically.

**Option 2 - Run Backend and Frontend Separately:**

If you prefer to run them separately, open **2 terminals**:

**Terminal 1 - Backend Server:**
```bash
php artisan serve
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend Assets (Vite/Mix):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 8. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Database Connection
- Make sure MySQL/database service is running
- Double-check the configuration in `.env` file
- Ensure the database has been created

### Error: NPM Dependencies
If error occurs during `npm install`:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Error: Composer Dependencies
If error occurs during `composer install`:
```bash
rm -rf vendor composer.lock
composer install
```
